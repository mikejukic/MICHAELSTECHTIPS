                <p> Some websites are not what they look like, some website intend to do the opposite of what they set out to do. This page is all about looking out for unsafe websites</p>

                <p> There are many website out there purely just to mislead users on the internet to get their personal details. One way to look out for it is to see if it has a little green padlock on the side of the url bar as well as this, you can sometimes tell the difference between a legitmate and illegitimate website is just the quality of the site. If it doesn't look profession and it is promising to do something to deal with your bank account etc. than it is probably fake. Another unsafe site to look out for the fake virus advertisement. Many sites do not control their advertisements and these people can use that as an advantage especially to people who have not read this. It says that you have a virus on your computer but it makes you install all this adware and spyware which slows your computer and also gathers your information. A great example of this is a hack on windows computer when people got locked out of accessing their files and forcing them to pay a large some of money or get their files deleted.</p>

                <p> Looking out for unsafe websites is worth your time because if not you might fall for one of these scams.</p>
