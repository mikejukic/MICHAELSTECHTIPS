                <p>Learning about cybersecurity is one of the most important things about learning about a network and browsing the internet. Cybersecurity is a broad topic, but basically it is all about being safe on the web and making sure that your personal information is safe and secure. Cybersecurity can't always be about hacking it could also be if you tell other people online your personal details and you think its a good idea to share it with them. Once your personal information gets out there it is basically impossible to delete it off the internet. You can always delete a post on twitter or instagram but there will always be a file containing what you said or what someone else said, so if your information gets out there than it will spread like wildfire and there is not much chance of getting it back. Cybersecurity is very important and any user on the internet has to be well informed about it otherwise they could fall into a dangerous part on the internet. </p>
