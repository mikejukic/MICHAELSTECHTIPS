                <p>Here is what to do and what not to do on the internet. There isnt a specific set of rules of the internet but it is just basic web etiquette you should follow. </p>

                <p>There are many things on the internet and one thing could change everything. You can do a lot of stuff on the internet, like watching videos, playing games, listening to music and talk with friends just to name a few. Knowing how to use them is a different thing, you see when browsing, choosing the right site to go to is everything. Most sites are tailored to a specific age point like you wouldnt let a 5 year old go on a site designed for 18 year olds. One thing to not do on the internet is to never give away your personal information to anyone. Even if you think that you are talking to a real friend it probably isn't and it's probably a person just being nice to obtain your personal details. It is ok to be friendly to people on the internet, but being friendly is enough. If he is trying to push you to ask information then either leave or report them to someone. You can go on chat rooms and stuff like that but be careful for some people posing as younger people and asking you to meet up. If you are talking to one and you think it may not be a genuine person than contact the police immediately.  </p>
